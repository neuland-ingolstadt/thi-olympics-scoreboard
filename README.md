## Login and scoreboard

Faculties can get access by contacting [Philipp Opheys](mailto:philipp.opheys@neuland-ingolstadt.de). At this point, teams and games get added manually by neuland-ingolstadt.

Each Faculty can give each team as many game points for their own game, resulting in a ranking, used to calculate global points.
